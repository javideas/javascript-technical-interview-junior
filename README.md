# Javascript Technical Interview Junior Full Stack
My journey to become Junior Full Stack Developer


Git Notes:<br>
-Create a branch for the first chapter: <b>git branch #-name-of-exercise</b>.<br>
-Switch to the new branch: <b>git checkout #-name-of-exercise.</b><br>

-Commit the changes: <b>git commit -am "Added content for #-name-of-exercise".</b><br>
(maybe better "git add ." alone and later "git commit -m "with message"<br>
-Push the branch to a remote repository: <b>git push -u origin #-name-of-exercise</b><br>
